#1.Introduction:
In this time of technology development, and this special situation of coronavirus pandemic where everyone is locked down you may think about learning new skills including programming to improve your qualifications and add more value to your life and skills, and you may have faced this problem of looking for platforms to learn the programming language you want, and then you got distracted by how many different platforms you may or may not know that they are suitable for you, or you may not know if you are on the right way of learning. 
Our project is a website that will sort your learning resources according to your level and the programming language you want to learn, so you won't get distracted and won't waste your time looking for what's good and what is useful.
